To date, the client allows researchers to perform the following functions:</p>

<ul><li>Create and edit study subjects</li>
<li>Create and delete pedigree relationships</li>
<li>Create and delete twin relationships</li>
<li>Configure pedigree modelling and visualisation functionality</li>
<li>For a given proband, retrieve an inferred pedigree membership, complete with relationship labels</li>
<li>Generate and retrieve a pedigree visualisation</li></ul>
